Todo:
	☐ Splash for @small
	☐ Splash "houston" "round top" scroll-to buttons
	☐ scrollspy active section link function research?
		- if that works, then give anchor names to sections
		- also should nav then bcome sticky?
Round Top Section:
	✔ make a JDF Showroom image as logo in same image ratio as bader ranch @done (23-10-10 16:15)

Our Story:
	✔ Remove Nicolas and add Gloria @done (23-10-10 16:15)
		- use a photo from milieu mag? will have to give credit undernath, but that's fine
	☐ Could duplicate the photo and use as background but give blur, just like with greencare
	☐ Or alternatviely make abackground collage with all the in the media ads, just like nicolas-watine.fr
Additional Thoughts:
	☐ Include active instagram banner, like miriamrodriguez.com ?
	☐	Put Houston on new page??? Yes perhaps. Bc right now it's a very long page
