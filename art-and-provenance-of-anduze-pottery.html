<h1>The Art and Provenance of French Anduze Pottery</h1>

<h2>The origins and practices of the Anduze pottery craft date back hundred of years.</h2>

Some of the world's finest pottery has been crafted in the southern Provençal French region of Anduze for hundreds of years. Artisans from the area still craft urns, biot jars, castelnaudaries and more in the same method as craftsmen did generations ago.

While the methods of crafting French Anduze Pottery remains the same today, the role of authentic Anduze Pottery in la vie Française has evolved over time. From its humble beginnings as a simple garden urn, to the grand statement they make in parks and palaces today, the presence of an authentic Anduze piece efortlessly elevates any space.

<!-- history here -->
Some sources will say that the origins of the classic Vase d'Anduze date back to the time of Henri IV in the 16th century, when a French potter fell in love with Medici Urns upon visiting Florence, Italy. This is local legend however, and their origins story is actually a much humbler tale.

While the region of Anduze is situated close to the Mediterranean, it does experience cold winters, and so the local citrus trees need a method of being moved indoors during freezes.

To sculpt the iconic Vase d'Anduze, they begin with a wood frame in the natural curved shape of the pot – wide at the top, and curving gracefully downwards to a flat pedestal base.

Next, they tightly wrap thick rope all the way around the frame, starting from the base, and winding, layer by layer, to the top.

Once the rope has been securely fitted, the artisans then begin the process of “throwing” the clay onto the rope structure, covering the entire framework.
