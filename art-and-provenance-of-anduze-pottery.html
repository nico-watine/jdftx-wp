Some of the finest pottery has been crafted in the southern Provençal French region of Anduze for hundreds of years. Artisans from the area still craft urns, biot jars, castelnaudaries and more in the same method as craftsmen did generations ago.

To sculpt the iconic Anduze urn, they begin with a wood frame in the natural curved shape of the pot – wide at the top, and curving downwards to a flat pedestal base. They then tightly wrap thick rope all the way around the frame, starting from the base, and winding, layer by layer, to the top.

Once the rope has been securely fitted, the artisans then begin the process of “throwing” the clay onto the rope structure, covering the entire framework.
