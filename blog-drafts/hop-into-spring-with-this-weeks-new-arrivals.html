Hop Into Spring With This Week's New Arrivals!
no, save "hop" for when you announce the easter gift baskets



cube planters
can be hampshire
AND the metal ones we've had for a while
can also spotlight the hampshire with the small lady palm




la lavande soaps
the single rose/gardenia scented soaps
also the great giftable rose soaps in a small box
And the hen's egg soaps, both in the rectangle box and the handle box




egg soaps will make a great addition to an easter basket
the rose boxed soaps are always a lovely little gift



do i also want to feature desks?
Just got in the really nice red leather inset desk, and can also show the 2 others we have



lastly mention round top again

This whole line is sure to fit "squarely" right into your backyard.
