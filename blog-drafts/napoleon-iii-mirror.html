Featured Mirror - Napoleon III-period Louis Philippe Miroir
Around the Shop - Napoleon III-period Louis Philippe Mirror


We just got in a new antique <i>miroir</i> at our Houston Shop and it is, "how do you say," stunning. The craftsmanship and skill that went into the gold leaf of its gilt wood frame is incredible, and yet the charm of age still shines through in spots.

The true skill that antique gold leafing required
Authentic gold leaf is only microns thin, meaning around 1/1000th of an inch. and it was hand hammered into its final state. The advent of rolling mills in the early 1800s greatly sped up the process of crafting gold leaf, and the demand for gilt everything was finally being met.

Where before a goldsmith would begin with a bar of solid gold and hammer it down to a state thinner than paper, inclusion of the rolling mill greatly improved its crafting speed. The gold bar would be run through the roller press at the mill, eventually coming out as a flat sheet. That sheet was then hand hammered into a state thinner than paper, hundreds of times.

what do i want to focus on?

the age of the mirror, how it's a period piece?

How it was made, specifically the gold leaf frame?
Could also expand into the glass

Give a brief run down of napoleon III mirror styles, and include shots of our others?
Or just focus on this 1 mirror, bc of how truly special it is?

And if focusing on this 1 mirror, what exactly about it?
The gold leaf I'd say. How it's made. The gesso process, and the red bole, how gold leaf was made then, with the introduction of rolling mills, since gold leaf for gilting was in high demand?
