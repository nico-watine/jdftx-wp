As most shops are increasing their prices, ours are decreasing

As global prices rise, we're decreasing ours!
<!-- Maybe not this, talk about global/tariff/markets can be very triggering -->
Bottom line, we have lowered prices on our antique furniture bc we've had it a long time, and we're taking advantage of the global pricing situation to market that we're decreasing prices

<h1>While other shops are increasing their prices, we're decreasing ours!</h1>
<h2>Enjoy new low prices on all of our in-stock antique furniture!</h2>
Or should the "enjoy new low prices" be the main, and the "other shops" be the subheading?
Yes maybe

<!-- ---- -->
At our Houston Shop, we have all-new low prices on our antique furniture. From consoles to commodes, these new prices are here to stay - this is not a limited-time sale!

<!-- The events we are all hearing about have forced suppliers to increase their prices, and most retailers are passing those increased costs onto their customers. Because we are direct importers of all of our hand-picked French antiques though, our middle-man costs are traditionally smaller. We are taking advantage of this unique situation to lower prices on all in-stock antique furniture at our Houston Shop, so as to make these beautiful pieces more widely accessible. -->
