what do i want to focus on?

the age of the mirror, how it's a period piece?

How it was made, specifically the gold leaf frame?
Could also expand into the glass

Give a brief run down of napoleon III mirror styles, and include shots of our others?
Or just focus on this 1 mirror, bc of how truly special it is?

And if focusing on this 1 mirror, what exactly about it?
The gold leaf I'd say. How it's made. The gesso process, and the red bole, how gold leaf was made then, with the introduction of rolling mills, since gold leaf for gilting was in high demand?
