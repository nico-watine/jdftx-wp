It’s March, and that means the annual Spring Round Top Antique Fair is here! Starting this show, we are no longer at Bader Ranch, and are excited to announce both buildings at our 108 Compound Ln location will be open (Google Maps). We will be open the whole month of March, starting Saturday, March 1st, and ending on Saturday, April 5th.

Please note that all venues in Round Top have their own show dates, so you’ll want to plan accordingly. If you’re on the hunt for special pieces and want to shop our collection before the rush, we recommend coming right at the start of the month. However, if you prefer to make the most of your Round Top day trip, then we recommend coming the last weekend of March, from Friday the 28th to Sunday the 30th. Hope to see you here!
